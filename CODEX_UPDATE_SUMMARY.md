**Summary**

0x92 began contributing from commit `865b5f9` ("Add setup instructions and requirements"). Since that point the project received significant new functionality. Key additions include:

- A comprehensive requirements file and setup instructions for running the project
- A configurable `config.yaml` to store default cash, stop-loss percentage and extra tickers
- A Flask dashboard (`dashboard/app.py`) providing routes to view the portfolio, trade log, graph and a summary page
- A scheduler script (`daily_run.py`) to execute the trading script automatically at a chosen time
- A caching module for price data (`Scripts and CSV Files/cache.py`) used by the trading script to avoid unnecessary downloads
- A new `src` package containing a `Portfolio` class with asynchronous price retrieval and paper-trading helpers that call the broker module
- Paper trading functions and account/position queries through the broker API wrapper
- Extensive test suite covering the portfolio logic, manual trading helpers, dashboard routes, daily scheduler and broker interactions

A diff summary from the first Codex commit shows the scale of these changes—over a thousand lines added across new modules and tests. The repository now contains a modular trading system with scheduling, caching, a web dashboard, and paper trading support—all tested with pytest.
